**this tool is hosted at [https://nimisin.okos.uno/](https://nimisin.okos.uno/)**

this tool creates new toki pona words and attempts to define them using OpenAI  
i have not really focused much on accurate phonotactics yet  
this is my very first web application in python  
i have other student things to do and just wanted to get a minimally viable product hosted  
i will revisit this soon  

_note: this is intended for entertainment purposes_  
if you have any questions you're welcome to message me
